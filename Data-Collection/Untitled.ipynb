I have tried four or five different Thai restaurants over the past two years, and this one is by far the best in the neighborhood. \\xa0Conveniently located near the 7th Ave & 9th Street, F/G subway. \\xa0I ordered take out, but they have seating if you prefer to dine in.Gai Yang (grilled chicken) - Unbelievable flavor, and moist. \\xa0The chicken has a really nice grilled char that is not mentioned in the menu description.Pad See Yew (flat noodles with shrimp) - Great flavor and they use fresh shrimp that isn't stringy.Poh Pia Tod (crispy veggie spring rolls) - Great vegetarian option. \\xa0 Full of flavor, nice and crunchy, not greasy.Jintana's Moo Tod (spice rubbed baby back ribs) - Very tender and the meat falls off the bone. \\xa0I believe you get 5 ribs.Their soups look and smell great and I want to try these next.\"},\n",
    " {'2-z6dRAkKupCyz1LF251pQ': 'It is nice to see another Thai restaurant on 7th ave. \\xa0Whenever I try a new Thai restaurant, my first order is something very standard. \\xa0In this case it was the green chicken curry and a pad see ew with shrimp, and an order of spring rolls. \\xa0Both the green curry and pad see ew were excellent and from the first bite you can tell they are using good quality and unique ingredients. \\xa0I ordered the green curry spicy and it was definitely spicy. \\xa0They have an option called \"Thai spicy (extra spicy)\" that I am going to try next time. \\xa0I will likely try one of their more unique dishes next time as well.I ordered take out and they forgot my spring rolls so I have no comment on those. \\xa0This is also why I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5.'},\n",
    " {'2-z6dRAkKupCyz1LF251pQ': \"I always am down to check out highly-reviewed Thai restaurants in Brooklyn! \\xa0My friend and I arrived at Jintana Thai Farmhouse around 7pm on a Saturday. \\xa0For the location, I was surprised that it was pretty busy. \\xa0The front of the house has a small seating area, but when I went to use the bathroom in the back, there are tables there and outside! \\xa0We got lucky and a table opened up right when we arrived, but they started taking reservations, so try to make one if you can. \\xa0I ordered the khao soi ($14) and my friend ordered massaman short ribs curry ($20). \\xa0The khao soi had a slightly above-average presentation, and the curry had an average presentation. \\xa0As other people noted in their reviews, Jintana does a fantastic job with flavor. \\xa0As soon as the khao soi was brought to the table, I could smell the wonderful aromas from the spices. \\xa0Both curry broths were delicious, but nothing out of this world. \\xa0The beef in my friend's curry was cooked well and was soft and juicy. \\xa0The only low-point of my meal was that the drumstick did not have good flavor and was dry. \\xa0To compensate for this, I broke it up and soaked it in the curry. \\xa0Pricing is slightly overpriced, but competitive with other Thai places in the area.My one issue at Jintana is that they have awful customer service. \\xa0However, I understand that they are still a new business, so I can forgive it once. \\xa0Our food took over twenty minutes to come out. \\xa0In addition, there was little attention to our waters, although they did do one check back. \\xa0Also, they took a ridiculously long time to bring us the check and then process it. \\xa0I understand that they need to turn tables quickly, and we waited about a half hour just to get the bill and to pay it, which they could have used to seat another party. \\xa0Overall, I did like the food here, but unless the service is improved, I would prefer to go somewhere else with better service.\"},\n",

Tell me how their lemongrass ice tea tastes just like the cereal milk at the bottom of a bowl of Fruity Pebbles???!!! Every sip puts you in a playful mood, which kind of begets eating your face off. I was really impressed by two of the entrees we ordered - the ground chicken and basil with fried egg (Pad Krapow) and the mixed vegetables with fried tofu (Pad Phuk Ruam). Make sure your date is as much of a foodie as you are! It's a Thai experience that must be shared!!!\"},\n",

Everything comes out stacked one top of each other. They separate the tinned bowels for you to enjoy. The wait was a little long to get the check and everything packed. Overall I enjoyed the food and would come back again.'},\n",
    " {'2-z6dRAkKupCyz1LF251pQ': \"Born in Asía.. Thai food is in my blood. It's my favorite cuisine and I hold high standards. I have to admit that I was extremely skeptical to see this restaurant in the same storefront as another Thai spot which closed its doors a few years ago. But I decided to try it as I simply cannot refuse Thai food . And I was overjoyed I gave it a chance For Thai food outside Thailand , Jintana ranks high in my view. Thai cuisine is a fine balance between spicy, salty, sour & sweet flavors. Jintana is definitely on the sweeter, less spicy side but you can request spice level . When I'm feeling brave next time I will ask for medium Thai spicy. They have a great lunch special deal that I highly recommend. Here's how I rate their food: Basil ground chicken 5 stars Tom Kha Gai soup 5 stars Pad See Eu noodles 2 stars Mixed Vegetable & Tofu 4 stars My favorite spot to sit in the restaurant is overlooking the open kitchen where I can see the clearly experienced Thai chef masterfully tossing the fresh ingredients with graceful ease in the magnificent pitch black seasoned wok . I am cooking up a master plan \\xa0to steal this guy \\xa0to be my personal home chef! The super friendly host informed me that the most authentic dishes on the menu are: Papaya salad, Laab \\xa0Salad , Gai Yang , Branzino I will return for dinner soon!!!!\"},\n",

Discovering an Asian place on Yelp nearby, we placed our name down, and we were given a link to an app that manages the wait time. We waited next door sipping on matcha bubble tea.When we were called back in 15 min (we were originally told 30 min), we let the host know we were texted in. We got seated within a few min. We were seated in their back super cute garden.We ordered tom yum soup with their big shrimp, green papaya salad (spicy peppers), and panang currt with chicken with jasmine rice. It was filling and delicious. Service managing the line in front was a bit unsettling and our waitress seemed confused at times. But otherwise, the food seems authentic in taste but decor and ambiance a good fit for Park Slope hipsters. Thank you!\"},\n",
    " {'2-z6dRAkKupCyz1LF251pQ': \"Great addition to the Park Slope neighborhood. \\xa0The menu here is different from most of the generic Thai restaurants in the area which I appreciate. \\xa0My friend and I shared the papaya salad, the grilled branzino, and the green curry with shrimp. \\xa0I loved the grilled branzino which came with this delicious sauce on the side which I wanted to put in everything. \\xa0The papaya salad was just okay and the green curry was my least favorite dish we ordered. \\xa0The curry was really thin and was more soup than a curry. \\xa0There was very little vegetable and shrimp in the curry and I thought it lacked more ingredients and flavor. \\xa0Overall, I'd give the food 3 stars and 1 additional star for the really good attentive service we got from the waiters.\"},\n",
    " {'2-z6dRAkKupCyz1LF251pQ': \"Delightful addition to the neighborhood, incredibly fresh, high quality, elevated Thai food. We split several dishes which were each remarkably diverse yet incredibly complex and flavorful. Whether as a starter or a healthy light entree, the Rainbow Rice Salad--with blue rice mixed with assorted options such as grapefruit, purple cabbage, shredded coconut, lemongrass and bamboo shoots was both a visual and flavorful delight. The Khao Sol house specialty curry was incredibly complex, the curry with some nice heat at the end, the noodles terrific and the succulent chicken literally falling off the drumstick--could have eaten it all day, and hated that we had agreed to share.That wasn't even my highlight, though--the steamed fish prepared and served in a coconut shell (Hor Mok Talay) was so inventive and flavorful, literally stuffed with seafood. Maybe a touch heavy on the coconut, but then... I love coconut. They have only open for a couple of days, so still working out the service kinks--it was crowded and service a bit slow, with one dish coming out well before the others. It's hard for this New Yorker to let slow service go and not ding them a star, but the food was so high quality, and space so lovely I have complete faith, and can't wait to come back for more. Will be open for lunch as well as dinner, and it's bring your own booze.\"},\n",
    " {'2-z6dRAkKupCyz1LF251pQ': \"It's a boisterous hangout for the gang after a long day at work. Jintana's Thai Farmhouse Is a farm-to-table restaurant located steps away from the 7th Avenue Station on the F/G lines on the subway, or along the B69/B67 and B61 bus routes. The restaurant at the front has three booths, two tables for four, and two tables for two inside at the front, it's a place for close quarters in a boisterous environment. Outside in the back, there are six two-person tables, and three picnic benches seating six. During peak hours do expect at least a 20 minute wait for walk-ins; a reservation is a good idea during that time. In the back, however, industrial fans take away from the vibe, but in the summer, it's an okay trade off.No alcohol menu; BYOB.The Moo yang hor khao neual (pork tenderloin roll) is a great appetizer to share; two rolls of meat, chopped to bite size. spicy, sweet, sour is all in there. If the 'spicy' is a scare, you can enjoy it without; the spicy is brought out in the chili dipping sauce. The Duck Breast curry: this is a great opportunity to try jackfruit- this is likely the best way to taste it if you've never had jackfruit before and you know it's a commitment if you had to buy the whole fruit. The duck breast is tender, and goes well with the jasmine rice. It comes with peppers, green beans, small tomatoes, tangerines, eggplant and kale. Perhaps the Tangerines could be supremed to let out more of the sweetness? This is an uncommon but interesting flavor combo to try.The dessert of the day: Taro, coconut, warm sweet milk. This would deffo be a great treat to have during the cooler months. I have to say that this was a great treat day when I tried this place. I'll definitely be back!\"},\n",

    " {'2-z6dRAkKupCyz1LF251pQ': \"When I learned that there would be a new Thai restaurant opening up in Park Slope and right across the street from my favorite, Gather, I was super excited to check it out and just had an opportunity to do it last night. By the way, last night was their 2nd night so it was a bit chaotic. It was pouring out, but people kept coming in to check out this new Thai restaurant in the neighborhood. Because I was by myself so I didn't have to wait long and was seated in a big table (Huge shoutout to my waiter! This guy deserves it) I told him he could move other customers to that big table and I could wait, but he said that he would rather get me seated right away. THANK YOU! He was also super polite & nice. I was hungry so I tried to order way too much for one person and he recommended me something in a smaller portion that was best for one person. I ended up ordering Iced Thai Coffee. I honestly wish that they would have had more options with milk. I didn't really want half & half with my coffee, but again it was their only 2nd night! So I suggested them this as well. Then I ordered Tom Yum Soup (Shrimp) for $6 which was perfect for me! I also ordered some white rice and Pork Tenderloin Roll (Moo Yang Hor Khao Neaw) -- basically Grilled Pork Tenderloin stuffed with sticky rice. I have to say that I liked the combination. Although a few pieces were kinda hard to chew, but I still liked the flavor of it. Tom Yum was definitely amazing. My bill came out about $30 with tips so yeah, it was pretty pricey, but I have gone to a bunch of Thai restaurants and this one is definitely one of the great ones. They have a pretty great start in my opinion ;) The great part is that you can definitely see the chef cook behind the glass walls on top of great service. I honestly cannot wait to come back to check out something else on the menu and next time, I would try to bring more friends to try this place out, too!\"},\n",

Instead, it was very juicy and rich, was a soft little bun that left no question that the real star was the double patty itself. My friend had the shrimp and sausage etouffee and upon having a bite, he insisted that I sample it! Those chewy, perfectly textured rice cakes, my word! And that sauce! Absolutely delicious. For drinks, we both started with the watermelon margarita on special and then had different drinks from their well put together cocktail menu. Both my friend and I were very pleased as everything we ate and drank here was exceptional. We arrived at 8 pm on a Thursday. There were a few people at the bar and a couple or two at the tables.

The bartender was super friendly and had a nice, chill playlist on. They have an intimate backyard too but I was in the mood for some AC. Not only was the drink and service excellent but to my surprise, they offered me a delicious sloppy joe with my happy hour drink which was the icing on the cake and also pleasantly nostalgic!

We were warmly greeted by Matt and he gave us a rundown of the drink & food menu as well as the specials.I had the deviled eggs (which were to die for) and my friend had pork candy for appetizers. For our entree, my friend had the pork tenderloin special and I had a flaky, white fish that I can't seem to remember the name of but it was cooked down in a buttery suave with sorghum and another grain (maybe cous cous or fennel). What I do remember is that it was so damn delicious that I didn't remember to take a photo of the food before gobbling it down! It was super flavorful and freshly made. I enjoyed the citrus and herb flavors. The deviled eggs had either lime or lemon juice as well as scallions in them and light seasonings but it was heavenly!I hope to be back soon to try their Mac and cheese appetizer as well as some other dishes.

The interior design is very cozy and cute. They have an outside patio with cute greenery and lights so we sat outside since it was a nice cool day. We ordered some cocktails, I got the Devereux Spritz and my partner got the Dr Feelgood. My drink was lighter with orange and prosecco which I crave for. The Dr Feelgood had a good chili kick with ginger so it was quite nice. For appetizer, we ordered the devils eggs and Mac and Cheese. The devils egg had crabs and okra so it was quite delicious and different from the traditional devil eggs I had. The mac and cheese had pesto and some nice breadcrumbs on top so it was very creamy and flavourful. Our main entree is the fried chicken with mash potatoes and collard greens. The fried chicken was super tender and juicy! The outer layer was just right and not over breadcrumbs. They had this delicious blueberry hot honey where you drizzle a bit on the food and it gives a nice tingy flavor. I really enjoyed all the food! Lastly, we got their main dessert brownies with ice cream. They recommended we drizzle some blueberry hot honey on top as well and it tasted delicious! Highly recommended to check it out. **If you decide to sit outdoor, make sure to spray some bug repellents or wear long sleeves and pants to cover yourself. Got quite a few mosquitoes bites but with the cute ambiance outdoor it was worth it. They offered us bug repellents and etc.**The service was excellent.

He offered us unthinkable flexibility -- from the number of people we wanted (we were so unsure of how many would rally after the wedding and he was comfortable with that) to the food we wanted (they'd make anything from their menu or if we wanted to come up with something else they'd make that, or if we wanted to bring in pizza he was ok with that too!) And this is the big kicker -- he was flexible with the hours they would stay open! \\xa0And thank goodness because it turned out that so many people came and stayed and we had the most raucous, memorable dance party that carried on into the wee hours. \\xa0Oh and the other kicker is that Dan let us bring in our own DJ, complete with turntables and everything, so we were in complete control of the vibes and the music was that perfect old school hip hop we were missing from the actual wedding. The bartenders were the best too, they even got into the party, dancing and enjoying themselves. The tater tots and sliders we'd ordered were perfect, providing sustenance so we could keep going and going. Planning this party took maybe one or two casual emails back and forth with Dan, who always said yes and added a level of option or flexibility, always keeping me at ease that planning this was not going to be a headache, just a pleasure. My husband and I went back to the bar after seeing the Bowie exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum. \\xa0We sat at the bar and had their other delicious food and reminisced about the greatest night of our life that lasted into the morning.

The fried chicken was so juicy, the skin was crispy and spicy and there was a good amount of heat on the meat as well. Their \"hot sauce\" that they have on the table wasn\\'t very spicy though, but it added a nice flavor to the meat. The sweet potato fries were stellar as well!

I would come back just to order five of these all for myself. The grits were incredible as well. So glad this was my first time trying them, what a treat! I was in the mood for eggs so I ordered scrambled eggs (big mistake!!!!) they were okay but nothing spectacular, kind of dry. My boyfriend got the chicken sandwich and I wish I had too, it was so delicious. I was immediately jealous after he let me try a bite. The coffee was actually really good too. Only reason I'm giving it 4/5 is because our waitress was so slow. She also forgot to bring my coffee for about fifteen minutes and repeatedly took forever to bring things we asked for, we noticed it was the same for the table next to us too.

I have a pretty high spice tolerance, and my mouth was on fire. I wish they had a spice level between regular and 'hot' because I will say that the spiciness was borderline distracting. But so good. But somewhat painful. I will say it looks like they're inconsistent with how much spice goes on the chicken -- the girls at the table next to us also ordered the hot chicken, but ours definitely had a lot more spice mix on it. \\xa0The pickles were crisp and delicious, and cut through some of the spiciness. The mac and cheese was also so good!!! It came out hot, and the cheesy sauce was very smooth (what's up with all the grainy mac and cheeses out there lately? Who is into this stuff?). The cornbread was pretty dry, nothing to write home about. For drinks, we got the Sweet Georgia Brown (bourbon and sweet tea), which was awesome and also helped cool my mouth in between bites of chicken.I'm actually surprised to see so many complaints about the service -- maybe we were just lucky, but our waiter was very attentive, and took our food and drink orders very quickly. And the food came out in record time! Don't think we waited more than 5 minutes for our meal.

We returned the greeting and ask for recommendations... of course, we inform the gentleman at the register (co-owner) that beef isn't an option so he suggested the chicken and fish. My Queen went with the crusted salmon over white rice, chickpeas, and the coconut (ginger I think) sauce. Mine was the jerk chicken over brown rice, red beans, and the tomato base. Both means were individually delicious, there was zero food envy at the table and the sorrels we bought were great additions.Personally, the jerk bowl doesn't need anything... it was great by itself. The fish on the other hand, though delicious and balanced was slightly enhanced by the pepper sauce. Disclaimer!!! PEPPER SAUCE is NOT the same as HOT SAUCE, so don't use it the same way.

Indeed it was, I'll never try that again since there was star anise involved and it was bitter, neither of which I like. The sorrel here is different from what I've had in other places as it was almost syrupy sweet and strongly flavored, it's not something I'd order again. They do make and bottle their own hot sauce, which I was told wasn't spicy but flavorful. I dipped just the end of the tine of my fork to taste, and I immediately had to drink my water. Not spicy?! To each their own!I chose the salmon ($16) with brown rice and chickpeas served with coconut ginger sauce. The salmon is a little more than one inch strip that was just a touch overcooked and slightly sweet. The coconut ginger sauce was tasty and done well, but I feel that they could have been more generous with it. Curry chickpeas were lightly flavored in a good way. I feel that the price point is wrong with the amount of food or vice versa, that is given for this neighborhood.

We had a bone piece of meat and ya boy was just licking and sucking the bone after the meat was killed. It was so succulent and juicy. UNREAL. The sauce and seasoning with the meat was the best combination ever. The sauce was so creamy and added more layers of flavor to the already juicy meat. The rice was just fluffy and soft. Not undercooked or overcooked. Just right. My only complaint is that the place itself was hot inside. AC wasn't on or anything. Just a fan.

The decor was fresh and clean, but I was seated next to a wall barrier with plants that was a bit in my head space, literally. The bathroom was clean and spacious, and probably pleasant if they weren't burning incense in there. They give you complimentary chips that has a bit of a spicy topping to it that is cut on the thicker side and crispy. Brussel sprouts were pretty good but I feel like it was drowned too much in the sauce as some was crispy in the beginning but became mushy towards the end. The pork loin was bordering on the spicy side due to whatever rub they were using, but I did enjoy it since it wasn't dry though, the crispy fries that came with it, could've used more salt. Oddly, when asked for BBQ sauce, they didn't have any... but they serve bbq items... hmm. My food partner and I, both ordered the smoke ramen. I'm disappointed even though I had low expectations. The smokiness was there but, there was no depth in flavor for the broth, which wasn't much as well. You only get that umami flavor when the broth has been simmered for hours with certain ingredients. My food partner thought their broth was really good (because they added spicy garlic paste to it) until they had some spoonfuls of mine which didn't have add ons and was disappointed for me. The noodles were fine, the smoked pork loin was on the leaner side which was great, but didn't fall apart like other ramen places I've been to. My test is usually to try the classic ramen at every place I go to so there's a baseline but I jumped the gun on this one. The servers were quite nice so maybe I'll come back one day and the review will be different. Until then, I can't in good faith, recommend coming to this place for their smoked ramen.

I ordered the chicken and waffles which was really good. The chicken was nicely seasoned and the waffle was super fluffy. The syrup wasn't a normal maple syrup. Just a tad bit sweeter. There were no complaints from any of the guests about the food. The only complaint would be the drinks. We ordered a pitcher of sangria, they brought 2 and charged us for both. The sangria tasted just like white wine topped with fruit. Not like your typical sangria. I would definitely return but would like stick to the tea or juice.\"},\n",

Some west coasts, some Canadians, and of course, some east coasts.Their happy hour also consists of a $9 house cocktail (when I went, it was a very pleasant amaro spritzy drink), plus other drink specials. Mitch the bartender was awesome.Favorite drink of the night was definitely the smoked garden. It was a tequila drink with a Tabasco salt rim and a tiny rosebud floating in it. So good!In terms of food, you've got a lot of French fare, plus brunchy stuff through lunch. They're also surprisingly vegetarian friendly (surprising for a French restaurant, not for Bushwick...).

If we\\'re ranking strictly on food, 4 stars largely because although the food was a bit lacking in seasoning/flavor, it was certainly prepared well. The steak and eggs were decent; got the eggs poached and they came, well, poached (most places end up with this bizarre kinda-hard-boiled thing), and the steak itself was tender if not exactly the most exciting to my tongue. And although bacon is bacon, this bacon rocked... don\\'t know why; it just did.Minus one for charged refills per short glass. No cans or bottles delivered to the table, so we had no idea it was canned/bottled until after I questioned the check for having four diet cokes on it for one person (me). For all I know, one can yielded two glasses delivered to the table (seemed that way. Fresh ice each refill in an 8oz glass, standard cans are 12oz).Minus one for service defects more generally.

That is our usual brunch combo. One thing I noticed was how delicious my hollandaise was! I specifically commented on it during my meal. I didn't enjoy the toast my eggs Benedict was served on just because it was a bit tough and grainy. They serve local brews on tap here. We recently ventured to oyster bay and tried their honey beer.

Before coming here, I had seen this restaurant on television a few days prior on one of the food networks and mentioned how I would like to go here and so to me surprise, ended up here. Now I would advise before going here to make reservations because even on a Tuesday night, this place gets crowded to where a line is waiting outside of the establishment. Due to not having a reservation, we had to actually wait until they gave us the option to eat outside where a few tables were available. One of the things that surprised us was how attentive our waiter was towards his customers, he really showed interest. Enough of that, you want to know what we had and here it is. We ordered the Connecticut which is a Buttered Lobster Roll which comes with a few different side options such as fries in which I chose, a Baked Potato, Spinach and others. The Lobster Roll was pretty good but it comes only buttered and not with the Mayonnaise and celery and other goods that you are used to seeing on Lobster rolls. We also had the Crab Dip in which we saw on the show was well liked and highly suggested but unfortunately when we had it, it was first too salty to the point where we had to have our waiter take it back and when the new one came around, it lacked Salt and a bit of flavor and the chips it came with was wrong for it due to it being too burnt and with Old Bay Seasoning. Oh well, I guess you win some and you lose some. We had these fried Oysters with Spinach on top which was an interesting mix together which was only OKAY, not the best and probably due to the Spinach being too strong. The Star of the night and the last dish that we had was the 1.5 Pound lobster which was Huge for a 1.5 pounder and even could have passed for a 2 pounder. This Lobster was cooked perfectly and tasted great and BEST OF ALL WAS FRESH! A lot of the times when you go to Seafood Restaurants, the Seafood doesn't always taste as fresh as it should but here, that wasn't a problem. The lobster came with potatoes, and sausage in which we had the option in adding. The Sausage in which they used was good too. As for the price, this place isn't cheap so if you are looking for a cheapy but goodie, this isn't it! These items plus 4 glasses of wine ran us to about 150.

While it looks huge, we felt that it was a good amount of food for 2 people given the amount of shells that are left over after the cracking is done. Service was good - the staff was attentive and not hovering. It was both of our first time cracking lobster shells, so the staff was helpful in providing guidance in how to do so.

Next we had the FRIED LOBSTER ROLL which was good but I wouldn't get it again. The bold sweet caramel glaze and kewpie mayo overpowered the delicate taste of lobster. It was interesting but if you want to taste lobster, stick with the classic. The side of fries were overly salted. I recommend getting a different side.

Haven't had good service like that in a while! Loved his energy.

I was on the BQE(Brooklyn Queens Expressway) getting on the Brooklyn Bridge and I looked to my right and saw the their truck driving north. I honked at the driver and he said they were en route to get the lobsters! talk about dedication!! ugghhh sheer pleasure. Ok now back to the food. My favorite is the Connecticut Roll, with the East End chowder. The rolls are warm and buttery, and the soup is creamy and spicy. The Connecticut rolls have a choice of side, salad or fries I choose fries. Those french fries are well seasoned, double fried and crispy. They make you want to sing!. The Oysters Rockefeller is a great appetizer and is are large enough to share as is the funnel cake. Both are packed full of flavor, and make you want to shout.

It was pretty loaded which was nice but I also began feeling sick of it after some bites. If you're not the biggest fan of nachos, or if you're ehhhh about nachos in general, this dish might be better shared with someone else. Don't get me wrong, it is still delicious! It might just feel like too many flavors happening per bite which was slightly overwhelming for me!Coffee wise, I got an iced latte. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have any flavor syrups for their coffee. If you're a huge flavored coffee fan like I am, you WILL have to opt for simple syrup in your coffee here. Besides that, the espresso was still strong and smooth. No burnt espresso taste at all. Service was also awesome.

We took an open table and ordered coffees while looking over the menu. While ordering our meals, we were told Brunch menu items can't be modified, and that we'd only be able to add things, so I'm assuming things were not made to order(?). Sucks, as I was having brunch with a vegetarian and someone with multiple food allergies. They did have a few vegetarian options, but we wouldn't be able to customize items without meat, so choices were very limited. (tragic.) My friend with allergies originally wanted to order an item, asking it be made without avocados- but they couldn't do that for him so he ordered the biscuits. My boyfriend (vegetarian) ordered a breakfast burrito, they offered the chorizo add for meat eaters. I ordered the mushroom hash and added two poached eggs. For being pre-made or whatever the case, the food took a bit of time to come out. The server accidentally brought my boyfriend the burrito with chorizo, which he wouldn't have realized it had meat had I not tasted it first. Would've been unfortunate. :( My food -the mushroom hash- looked boring and plain with the arugula and greens on top, HOWEVER, the flavors of the beets and runny eggs and hashbrowns (with a ton of hot sauce) is something I still dream about today!! And with all the greens on my plate, it made it seem guilt free. hehe. My meal was very filling.

But you will always get my attention with chicken and waffles. And truly, brunch in our area is almost nonexistent, so I was near psyched when I was able to get a brunch ressy at Uglyduckling on the weekend so easily.And then you understand why.Truly, you head into the restaurant off of Smith St. and it is quiet. Not quite dead. But more quiet than a brunch place during brunch time on a weekend in New York should be.Who is maybe the owner or GM clearly controlled the floor and kindly welcomed us in. There were TVs around us set to different stations. Our waiter was sweet and attentive enough, and he did refill our water plenty.But the french toast we got for the table was not special. My chicken and waffles were...I wouldn\\'t say bland. More like \"meh\". I could make my own better (both the French toast and friend chicken. I don\\'t have a waffle maker).

Everyone there was really nice and cool from the host, to the bartender, and our server (shout out to Eric).For food we ordered the burrata, green bean salad, the lamb, pork and noodles, and a scoop of the Iemon bay leaf ice cream (this ice cream was really, really good).You must order the burrata! It comes with slightly charred, warm bread made in house. The burrata itself came with two purees-- one that was beet and the other that was squash, I believe, and a kind of pesto. We cleaned the bowl with the bread and I'm not ashamed about it!The green bean salad was fantastic! The peanut sauce was not over whelming. The beans, pickled watermelon rind and micro greens made the dishes really light and delicious.The pork and noodles is a signature dish and I can see why. The pork is mixed into to the noodles and gives it a really smoky rich flavor. I kept stealing my husband's noodles because they were that good.The lamb was so delicious, perfectly cooked and then rested on top of sweet corn grits. I don't normally like grits but these were so amazing. The corn flavor was light and the grits were not overpowering.

Cons: - Don't recommend the underwhelming Basmati (pork sausage, organic egg, hot sauce, and pico de gallo) brunch dish. While it looked pretty, there was little flavor, very little sausage, and the rice was undercooked. It was also on the smaller side, so it seemed more like a side dish than a main. - The brunch service was also underwhelming.

The restaurant itself is small and since I was a party of 2, I didn't think they would give us any of the 4 top tables anyways. Our server was really friendly and went over the food and drink menu. The drinks were very good. I recommend the revenge of the line if you like drinks with a little kick and spice to it. Super good. My brother had the bruce banner and it was also really good. For dinner I had the beef short rib ($23) which came with some potatoes and spinach. The beef short rib was very tender. It went very well with the potatoes and greens. The presentation was beautiful and for the price, much cheaper than all the places we tried in the city. My brother got the special which was a type of fish (trout?). It was a whole fish and he enjoyed it as well. For dessert we had the berry crumble w/ sea salt ice cream ($8) this was soooo good and half the price of a much worse dessert in the city we paid for at a fancier place. Warm gooey berry pie and cold sea salt ice cream....delicious!Overall, this restaurant was amazing. From the service, to the décor, to the drinks and food.

Filthy, graphic, profane exclamations of sheer unadulterated joy, sung out to the universe in the hopes you can make everyone feel the bliss coursing through your own veins.If I could give 6 FREAKIN stars I would ;)I really love New Orleans and try to cook (as best I can) the cuisine from that city. So people sometimes ask me where to go for Cajun in NY and I haven\\'t had many places to steer them. This is the place. The space is tiny, I\\'m already afraid of what happens when the rest of the city catches on to their greatness and wait times become agonizingly long. But for now, four 2 tops and a handful of seats at the bar offer an intimate atmosphere. The moment you walk in, Dr. Bob\\'s artwork greets you with the message, \"My Dreams of Red Beans\" (mocking those who come on Mondays perhaps, when the restaurant is closed). Crystal\\'s on the table, Abita Purple Haze - this is happiness. They offer $1 happy hour oysters, and these were the best $1 oysters I\\'ve ever had. East Coast, I forget the name now but I was thrilled.Me and my friend ordered all the big hits: gumbo, half and half fried oyster and fried shrimp po-boy, BBQ shrimp, and crawfish etouffee. I almost cried when I took my first bite of gumbo. I know, that sounds hyperbolic but this is just not something you can get easily, if at all, in NY. The roux is so dark, crab claws and shrimp poke out cheekily, the bright crunch of scallions, okra (not slimy), the perfectly cooked rice soaking up the complex flavors of it all. Ooompf. My friend said she had never eaten such soft fried shrimp as were on this po-boy. And I don\\'t think I\\'ve had a fresher, more flavorful fried oyster. Served on French bread and dressed with mayo, lettuce, tomato, and pickles, this is a no brainer. The BBQ shrimp are served head on, in Worcestershire & butter. The sauce was excellent, the shrimp were delicious, my only wish was the sauce penetrated into the shrimp a bit more, but still a strong choice. I don\\'t think you can order wrong here!That etoueffe though. Crawfish, bell peppers, onion, celery, shellfish gravy with rice. I\\'ve never attempted to make this like I have gumbo and jambalaya. To me, this dish is royalty. When it\\'s done right the world bows down to acknowledge it and this was perfect. Despite two of us ordering two apps and two entrees and oysters, every plate went back to the kitchen licked clean. I met the chef and owner afterwards, John, and hugged him and rambled on about how much my friend and I enjoyed his food and loved his city. He pretended like my intensity was totally normal and for that I\\'m very grateful! Also want to give a shout out to Zack, our sweet and attentive waiter who makes going above and beyond look effortless! More good things: the pacing of the food is on point. You\\'re never rushed, despite the small space, this is food meant to be savored and it\\'s presented in a way that lets you. And the music: Spill the Wine, Just Dropped In, Pictures of Matchstick Men, San Fraciscan Nights, Incense & Peppermints, Better Man (Leon Bridges). When Cajun mainstay Great Jones Cafe closed down, Chef Big Sexy of the Tao Group was making moves to take it over and change its cuisine, saying, \"Cajun\\'s not trending now\".Prove them wrong, give this place all the love it deserves.

I think my roommate either called ahead or put our name down in person, both good ideas, but the place wasn't busy when we were there. Service was friendly and fast, and there was a bar, though we didn't partake, as everyone else had to wake up in the morning and go to work. I imagine this is a solid spot to get a beer, though.The vibe was pleasant and relaxing, appropriate for a restaurant that evokes the Big Easy. The menu was full of New Orleans classics--gumbo, etouffee, red beans and rice. I got the muffaletta, a sandwich with prosciutto, capicola, salami, shaved parmesan, and house olive salad on a seeded Caputo's roll. My roommate and I had tried the original muffaletta at Central Grocery & Deli almost ten years ago in New Orleans. Hard to compare two sandwiches across that much time, but this one was tasty enough to stand alone. We didn't order dessert, but when we were done eating, our waiter brought out complimentary little glasses of coffee panna cotta, the house take on the famous Café du Monde café au lait. This was delicious, creamy and light, an ideal way to end any meal.I enjoyed Lowerline and would definitely go back if I lived in the neighborhood.

(I've come on a random Wednesday night and a random Thursday night when the craving struck and it was full but not overly so) Tonight I wandered in with two of my favorite eating buddies L.C. and D.G.. We each ordered a boil (1 lb snow crab with sausage and potatoes, mild. Two orderes of 1 lb shrimp+1 lb snow crab, medium). As L.C. and D.G. are good eaters, we took advantage of the 1 dollar wing and 1 dollar oyster happy hour deal by ordering 10 wings and 3 oysters. Combined with a few pouches of drinks, we were pretty much set for a good night. The wings, very much like their Chinatown location, were crispy, fresh, and delicious. The boils were everything I expected, saucy, delicious mildly spiced (as I preferred), with red potatoes and sausage cut on bias for optimal sauce coverage. So where did my oysters come in? They came with the option of raw vs grilled and I chose raw. However, they came out just after my boil. And by just after my boil, I mean literally that we got our boils and then a plate of my oysters was delivered to the table. At this point the wings had come and went. They were blue point oysters, decently fresh, and at a dollar an oyster, a great value. All in all the food was good though I would have wanted my oysters to come out with the other appetizers. So why three stars? In the end, I did have to remind the server that I had ordered raw oysters and wasnt really given an explanation as to why it took almost 40 minutes for three oysters to get to the table. Additionally, our server was very nice but her co-worker was very rude when she came to collect our check.

The real disappointment was that they seemed to have changed up the shrimp & grits recipe or they got a new cook, who knows, but they were both NASTY. They changed up the shrimp sauce so it was milky and thick. All of our shrimp was over cooked. The grits were chalky and pasty. Hellll noooo.The waitress came over started cleaning off our table and grabbed our plates without asking if we were finished or saying anything--my boyfriend was still eating. There was clearly still food in both of his bowls, but she just grabbed them away. He tried to tell her he wasn\\'t finished but the music was so loud that he literally had to scream it her even though she was standing right next to him.

Meanwhile the waitress really tried to overcharge us by saying \"didn\\'t y\\'all order a Riesling too?\" After that entire 20 minute meal we both looked at her like \"Really bih?

I'm not a huge fan of fried catfish but I really enjoyed this one. The breading was not too much and the flavor was good. The grits unfortunately tasted like it had been sat out for awhile, and it had settled. The taste was ok, the texture of it was not my favorite. And the herbed bread on the side was not good at all.

Couple minutes later waitress #1 bought out 2 shrimp dishes which never made sense to me because I didn\\'t order one because I\\'m allergic (and I definitely told her this) but she politely apologized and took it back. Five minutes after that my Tan Tan ramen finally arrived and I started eating. Two bites in I felt my throat, tongue, and mouth starting to itch and also my lips starting to swell. Alarmed, I called waitress #2 over and asked her if there was any sesame product in my dish and she confirmed that it was in fact made with sesame paste. I told her that waitress #1 insisted that there was none. Waitress #1 came over and apologized which was cool I guess but my thing is that I have an actual allergy.

Also, I asked for an Arnold Palmer and the server informed me that I can only have the Southern Tea Peach citrus mixed with Ginger Lemonade. I was like surely if you make ginger lemonade, you have regular lemonade. Shortly after, a couple were served what appears to be vodka lemonade by the bartender. Overall, amazing food and service.

We waited 20 minutes for a perfectly serviceable fried okra starter then the meal went steadily downhill. When our food did come, I couldn\\'t eat it. The crab cake in the salad didn\\'t look appetizing and looked like a lump of cold fish and mayo. The biscuits I ordered didn\\'t resemble anything I\\'d ever seen before - they were hard discs of bread. My boyfriend described his shrimp poboy as a simple shrimp sandwich, served on potato bread which looked nothing like the picture as his lacked lettuce, tomato and was served without sauce which cost $18! All told, we spent $45 for a really disappointing meal - $8 for both of our drinks, $8 for the okra, $5 for the \"biscuits\" and the aforementioned $18 for the poboy.

It took about fifteen minutes.When the little one and I got home, my sister was curious about the crawfish sliders, too.I took one bite and was so unpleased. The taste was completely bland. Nonexistent. No flavor, no pizzazz, no excitement, nada. I ate one crawfish slider and decided maybe the first one sucked. The second should be better.Nope. The second one was pure cardboard. The seasoning was definitely not there. I had crawfish before and I was expecting packed flavor but this here was pure garbage. Straight up.The steamed kale was blah. It was missing some garlic, oregano or something. There was no flavor.My sister usually trust my judgement so when she tried, she totally agreed with me. She never had crawfish before and wasn't happy either. I told her not all Cajun places are this bad. I almost gave up by the time I got to the beignets but they were somewhat decent.

We also had the cheese souffle appetizer, (Please get it!!) which came with gorgonzola ice-cream. You eat this by making a hole in the souffle, and eating it with the ice-cream, creating a heavenly mix of sweet and salty. For our entrees, we had the bouillabaisse and duck. The duck didn't blow me away, but was still good and rich. The bouillabaisse was amazing, especially the soup paired with the bread and dip it comes with. For dessert, we had some sorbets, which they make in house! I loved the atmosphere and the service as well. We sat outside in the back, which was like a garden.

    " {'mxDfu4bHwSXoCr3FRpyMsw': 'My girlfriend and I went here for their Tuesday Date Night special to celebrate our 4th year together. Boy were we impressed.The Date Night special is a prix fixe mystery menu served every Tuesday. For $100/2 people (so $50/pp), you get, as the website says, \"3 courses along with a bottle of red, white or rose.\" For a French restaurant of this caliber, this screams deal of the century.Your chosen bottle of wine arrives first of course. We chose the red wine as recommended by our waiter. It was a solid French red from the Languedoc region. It wasn\\'t the fanciest wine ever but it was buttery smooth, which is how I prefer my reds. After that, you don\\'t get 3 courses, but 4! Soup of the day or salad, an appetizer (2 choices), a main (2 choices), and a dessert (1 choice, though each person receives their own). Tea and coffee after dinner are INCLUDED in the prix fixe! That alone is $5-6 in most restaurants.We both got the soup to start, a delicious, complex, and slightly spicy turnip soup. I didn\\'t think I would like it but it turned out to be very appetizing. We then received our apps: mackerel for me, souffle au fromage for my girlfriend. Both fantastic and they complemented each other very well since the souffle was so rich and the mackerel was so light. It was clear the menu was designed with sharing in mind. Then our mains: dorade and hen. Once again, the two dishes were beautifully executed, delicious, and complementary. The hen was a substitute dish pulled from the a la carte menu as my girlfriend doesn\\'t eat pork and the other main on the prix fixe was braised pork. Dessert was a green apple tart set in a solid chocolate \"cup.\" Super delicate, light, and tasty. After dessert my girlfriend ordered a latte and I ordered a cappuccino, both of which were great.Only a couple dishes on the prix fixe were lifted from the a la carte menu, the rest, including the mains (the dorade and braised pork), were unique creations for the night. Awesome!They do offer the a la carte menu if for whatever reason you don\\'t want the Date Night prix fixe, and I was impressed by what was available. Whole, pan seared foie gras is so hard to come by these days with everyone mashing it into a cold pate (WHY???) and that odd legislation calling for its ban. The wine menu is also very extensive and surprisingly reasonable! Flipping through it I saw good French bottles in the low $20s... unheard of at these high tier French restaurants!The ambiance was very cute with candlelight, silver utensils, and banquettes. We were seated side-by-side at one of those banquettes, which I love. One wall is covered in a chalkboard list of all the farms that they gather their ingredients from. Great to be supporting all those farms!All in all, a wonderful meal. The Date Night special is incredibly good value and I would happily return with my girlfriend just for that mystery menu... or the foie gras. The chef is clearly gifted and is offering very, very reasonable prices for top notch, traditional French food. We will be back!'},\n",

They were just cleaning up from an event so we waited and had a drink at the bar which was nice. I ordered the burger medium expecting it to be just as amazing as I remembered it and it came back fully cooked -- no pink. The bottom bun was still cold. The mushrooms were wet and cold. And the top bun was burned and dry as if someone tried to toast or reheat an old piece of bread they had in the freezer. The beef itself was flavorless. I explained my concerns to the wait staff and he kindly returned it and had it remade. The new burger I got was basically the same-- dry bun, the kind that breaks in half when you try to take a bite, wet cold mushroom atop a flavorless beef patty that was still medium well. At this point I let my partner eat it (he'd eat anything haha), and I ate about 2 servings of fries.

Unfortunately in my case, I really like to eat so I was expecting portion sizes equating to value, but sadly, this was not the case. Quality, however, was on point.

The pretzel bun, the sauce, the meat, the cheese, and the onions are all individually delicious, so coming together it crafted the best burger!!! I tried to savor it for as long as possible, which was very difficult. I just wish that there was a crunch component built into the burger. It is a very messy burger, but it's all a part of the eating experience. I wish the fries were a bit more potato-ier as it was mostly just fried crunch outsides.

We recommend the ginger tofu/veggies/rice! Also the pad kee mao, which is appropriately spicy. There are lots of other noodle dishes and curries, plenty to keep you coming back for more.

In fact, if they were open past midnight I think they'd be in trouble, but handsomely profitable because it would be so packed on weekends after late night fun. Or, maybe us local taco lovers would be the ones in trouble. Please, I'd put my kitchen on 'time-out' and come here ALL the time without even thinking!I ordered takeout from here a couple years ago and the only reason why I forgot to return again is because it cost $55 for my friend and I to attempt to get full off one meal here from takeout, not even dining in with tip. After our shrimp and chicken tacos, chips and guacamole, and splitting a quesadilla, we were still hungry (no, we didn't have the munchies!). I personally feel the (taco) portions are small but it won't stop me from coming back after this second go 'round. The taco but was only one layer of soft shell tortilla that actually stayed put till the last bite. I will tell you, this is not your usual 'struggle' taco. On one end I was thinking the taco was so small and I finished it so fast that maybe it didn't have time to fall apart, but after complete evaluation, this taco is solid and champion status, if you ask me. There was NOT a ridiculous amount of greasy steak juice and there was no soggy tortilla letting the steak escape anywhere except to my tastebuds. I have a sister who used to cry when her tacos fell apart and I know if I brought her here, she wouldn't have any complaints! The flavor, oh boy, was memorable and I love that the taco already comes with a sliver of avocado! They know what they're doing in that kitchen. The service was great too. The lady at the register saw me struggling on what to order as I looked thru the giant menu on the wall and asked me if I needed help while offering me my very own paper menu. I thought that was pretty nice. Most places you walk in and you can't get a hello unless you're the first to open your mouth and all they wanna do is collect your cash and get to the next customer. I dig this spot and it's got a nice setup with great music and casual seating in front of the open kitchen.

El Jeffe isn't very big, so don't walk in here thinking you're about to snag space for you, your mama, and your cousins. Going alone or at most three people is a solid bet for you to get counter space. Also, you will wait for your food. You will order and it will probably be ten minutes before you have tacos in hand.

(I\\'d recommend you do this for groups larger than 3). The room was dimly lit with red and yellow hues making the environment feel warm and homy. We were immediately seated and despite there being only one server present for the entire restaurant, we were attended to adequately. The menu included a lot of Asian fusion dishes which all sounded delicious, as well as some dessert options. We started with an order of well seasoned Charred Broccoli ($8) and perfectly fried Herb French Fries ($5) that we dipped into Houssain ketchup and spicy mayo. Not long after, we were given our main courses: Fresh Handmade Wide Noodles w/ Shrimp and Lobster Essence ($21), Pang Fried Noodles with Braised Pork ($16), and Braised Beef Short Rib over rice ($19). The portions are quite substantial and we all ended up boxing leftovers. I personally ordered the handmade wide noodles which came with vegetables atop noodles and covered in a subtle shrimp/lobster sauce. The dish tasted similar to an Asian version of shrimp scampi, which turned out to be delicious and definitely better the day after. I tried a bit of Pang fried noodles, as well, from my friend and it was the right amount of crispy noodles to vegetable to meat ratio with all the flavor. However, I will say that particular dish can get a bit salty after a while. We unfortunately had no room for dessert.

My only con would be that the lighting was much too dim in the bar area. Can't wait to come back and try the wings and noodle dishes which I've heard are also phenomenal.\"},\n",
    " {'TRVWU2c4SzbsgWOo6Dz2Aw': \"It's been a while (3 years) since I've gone to Hunger Pang, so take this with a grain of salt. I'm really torn between a 3 and a 4 star review for this place. My gripe with this place honestly isn't about the food. The food was usually great, and they were accommodating of a food allergy many times (though not always). As I've mentioned many times I have a mushroom allergy. Usually this isn't a big deal. Most places will just leave it out and typically Hunger Pang was willing to do this. Why wouldn't they? They'd charge the same and save a few cents on ingredients. Because we had gone many times, I feel obligated to give it 4 stars. However, here's my caveat. I'm not sure if it's the owner, but the main guy there just always seemed like a dark cloud over what should've been a fun and happy place. They were normally packed. But on more than one occasion I heard him treat customers badly, or staff. I happened to be one of those customers. Normally when mentioning my allergy it wasn't a big deal. I'd order the Pang fried noodles with the pork (highly recommend this), and mention no mushrooms, please. I don't encounter this attitude often, but some pretentious restaurants get offended by allergies and don't take them seriously. I watched him roll his eyes and ten or twenty minutes later out came my food with, you guessed it, mushrooms. I had to send it back after seeing it, but unfortunately had already eaten a small amount. My night was ruined because of this. And honestly, if not for the interactions I've had watching, or on the receiving end, of this guy's pretentious attitude I would give it a 5 stars. Maybe he's changed since then, or maybe he doesn't work there anymore. But it still is a great place to eat, so long as you don't care about this dark cloud that occasionally might swing by and mess up their normally cheerful atmosphere. I still recommend giving it a shot.\"},\n",
    " {'TRVWU2c4SzbsgWOo6Dz2Aw': 'Oh, Hunger Pang, where do I begin? I\\'ve been here twice with friends and both times we had our minds completely blown by the amazing food as well as the quality of service (shout out to Jaday, the waitress, I\\'m sorry if I spelled your name wrong). Both times, she was super attentive but not in an overbearing way. \\xa0The first time, my friend and I ordered the pangry wings with king sauce (spicy), and the salt and pepper popcorn shrimp for appetizers, and downed a bottle each of the deliciously fruity Bluffer wine. For our main course, we ordered the general Guan\\'s roasted chicken, which came with a HUGE helping of fries, which we asked to be upgraded to \"truffle fries\" for a couple of extra dollars - well worth it! The chicken is sooo good! Juicy and tender throughout, with a crispy skin coated in a delicious glaze. We also ordered the pang fried noodles, which were my least favorite, not because they weren\\'t delicious, but because there were too many veggies for me to enjoy the glutinous noodles. We had the chocolate cake for dessert, which I need to know how they make because it is is soooooooo soft, and creamy, and delicious and just warms your soul. The next time we went, we brought another friend, and had the same appetizers, wine and General Guan\\'s roasted chicken (amazing again!). We decided to try the Jalapeño fried rice with shrimp, and the homemade wide egg noodles with braised short rib. Let me just say, the braised short rib melted in my mouth, the noodles were THICK and well coated in the sauce, and not too many veggies like the other noodles. The jalapeño fried rice is my new favorite! They were unlike any fried rice I\\'ve ever had - the flavors were excellent, with a hint of ginger, and topped with an over easy egg. We had the chocolate cake again. And had to order a second even though we were full. Its that good. The three of us left the place and in a state of euphoria. It is unbelievable that I only have one picture of the food - a photo of three spoons fighting over the last piece of cake. I\\'ll take better pics next time. Needless to say, we\\'ll be back! :)'},\n",

However, once I started eating, I didn\\'t feel like I was missing out one bit.Pork Chive & Cheddar Dumpling - my dining partner was absolutely enamored of this dish, and I had to give up more than my \"half\" of the cheddar crisp on the plate. This was a beautiful and fun dish, and we loved it, even if he wasn\\'t initially enthusiastic about ordering this.Spicy Tuna Avocado Bowl - we were a little too ambitious and ordered this as a starter, but the few bites we had we loved. \\xa0The tuna was fresh, and the greens, garlic crisps, and cherry tomatoes made for a lovely bit of freshness in between all the fat we were indulging in. This \\\\might be a great alternative to healthier eaters in your group.My lunch buddy had the Pork Belly Benedict, and while I found this to be a bit too rich for me, he absolutely loved this. \\xa0I had the P.L.A.T. - two generous slabs of pork belly, with lettuce, avocado (lots of avocado), tomato and aioli on a toasted bun, and I\\'d happily come back for this again and again. \\xa0To go along with this, a very generous side of crisp fries were provided to dip into spicy mayo and hoisin ketchup.Before we left (as if we weren\\'t going to come back anyway), Wally sold us on the chicken that I absolutely need to try next.

This place is so cute and is very well priced. We were in the area for a concert at the Barclays center so this was an excellent find.First to note this place is very budget friendly, which was a huge plus. Banh mis from $7 and pho from $10. We thought everything looked so good we started ordering a bunch. We ordered the shrimp summer rolls and the shrimp chips and salsa to start. The summer rolls were nice and refreshing the peanut sauce was everything you look for in one. Packed with flavor and gives you a craving to keep wanting more!The shrimp chips and salsa really hit the spot. The flavor combination was divine and my friend and I both were just so happy we ordered it. It was also pretty cool to hear the noise the shrimp chips make as you put the salsa on it.All the food came out rapidly so before we were even done with the first few chips and our first summer roll my short rib pho came out. I HIGHLY recommend this Pho!! I am not normally the one to order. Eef pho as I limit how much red meat I will eat. This was amazing! The short rib meat was melt in your mouth and the broth was delicious! At only $12 it was a steal. I was so stuffed by the time we left.My friend ordered the viet banh mi tacos and seemed to really enjoy them. It was definitely something I wish I tried!The service here was great and they really aim to please here and they did. They even refilled our salsa since we still had shrimp chips left and they kept putting more condense milk in my friends vietnamese coffee cause she loves her drinks insanely sweet the complete opposite of me.Thank you so much for hosting us with hospitality 5ive spice, we will return to try more of the menu for sure!!'},\n",

Really nice choice. The Pho was average at best. Small bean sprouts dish for the size of the Pho. The chicken wasn't well seasoned and the broth was quite bland. The appetizers were good. I found the peanut sauce with the summer rolls to be flavorful. The spring rolls were tasty but nothing outstanding. The service was quick. Almost too quick to be honest. Our orders were taken nearly as soon as we sat down, dishes were removed as we finished our last bite, and the check was placed before we could ask.

I'm not sure that I would order this again.The buns are small and more like an appetizer in my opinion. The fried organic tofu and shiitake bun was absolutely delicious. The soy glaze was sweet and tangy and the tofu was cooked to have enough crunch and moisture. I would seriously buy the sauce by the bottle.On my next visit...(which may or may not be within the next few days) I will order the tofu and shiitake bowl- the entree portion that comes with rice or zucchini noodles.The size of the restaurant is quite deceiving as it seems very small upon entering but it's actually pretty big.

It wasn't enough flavor and the homemade sauce on the side which was supposed to be hot had a weird sweet taste to it. My girlfriend got the Sweet Chilli Bun and couldn't finish it due to it's lack of flavor. We tried one more thing which was the Korean Ramen. We got it spicy with chicken. To my surprise the chicken was just the nuggets we already had (wish we would have known that), the broth resembled chicken noodle soup and the noodles were extremely hard. The check came up to $32.00 which is pretty good. I would come back for the happy hour.\"},\n",

Both chicken options were underwhelming but the ginger soy sauce was the slightly better option of the two . The beef bun was better I'd say but nothing to venture out to this area for again. And in regards to their main beef bulgogi bowl , it's a disaster ! Just a very salty overload of a chaotic hot mess is what I'd call it. \\xa0I'd say steer clear of that poor execution of a meal if I were you.

The highlights are their buns, Korean fried chicken & various appetizers (like the shishito peppers & sticky fries). It's not particularly kid friendly but if your kids are pretty mature, well behaved and adventurous eaters, it's ok for them. Soju (Korean alcoholic rice drink) is tasty and similar to a not so strong Russian vodka but w/ rice instead of potatoes.Fried tofu & shiitake buns are my favorite. They switched out the artichoke bun for a impossible burger bun. Missed the old, but love the new. My teenage son loads up on the Korean fried chicken buns.

It was fairly similar to a bibimbap, and the zucchini noodles were amazing. They didn't cheap out on them either. The bowl wasn't the most traditional kind I ever had, but it was a fairly healthy meal and pretty filling for what you got. The kimchi was okay, nothing to write home about, honestly I'd skip it next time and get a bun.The service was very fast.

Then, I ordered the spicy Korean Ramen with Pork. I was worried that the American cheese would be that fake nasty cheese that looks and taste plastic but I was so wrong!

Like seriously, this place was TOUGH.My friends and I were in NYC for a week, we had one week to taste some of the best places NYC has to offer and this was one of them. The bulgogi bun was fire. I mean you can't really go wrong with some bulgogi unless the restaurant doesn't know what they're doing, but I promise you this joint knows what they doing. The buns were so steamy and soft, it works so well with really anything they put in between it. I'd recommend any of the buns honestly. The bulgogi was marinated just right and not overly powerful, it complimented the bun just nice. We also got the spicy fried chicken bun, and I'm from the south so we know wuzpoppin when it comes to fried chicken. You can't tell us anything bout fried chicken. Admittedly this Korean take on fried chicken was pretty good. The fried chicken was perfectly crispy and the pickled daikon just cuts through some of that fattiness and marinade that it works so well together. Tie it all together with a bun and it was FIRE. We also got the pork jowl bowl and that was just as good. Everything tasted fresh and not frozen at all. It was just a mixture of stuff and it worked together so well. From the vegetables to the pork to the rice offered so many different textures that came together amazingly. If I am ever in NYC again, I am for sure coming back to try the rest of the menu.I must say there are a few cons to this place. One being that it's very small. I can only imagine how much business they would have if it was a bigger restaurant. I do enjoy the intimate personal ambiance, but I feel bad for people that have to wait a while on a busy night. Another thing I didn't like was the price. It was a bit pricey, but keep in mind I'm not from NYC. I've had just as good or even better buns for cheaper, but the price would not deter me from eating here again. It would just stop me from eating here regularly. If you're in the area, definitely try this place out and I promise you won't trip. Fire.\"},\n",

The server even let me try both the Spicy Korean and Soy-Ginger sauces before ordering as I couldn't decide between the two. They do have different flavor profiles and both good in their own way!I do believe you get a better value with the bulgogi rather than the chicken. I was the only one to order the chicken bowl. They served two small pieces of chicken in the bowl, which looked to be the size that would fit in a bun. This meant I quickly ran out of chicken before finishing the rice and veggies. Minor annoyance but at least my friends shared their bulgogi bowls with me! The bulgogi bowls were pleasantly full of meat that when you mix it all, you get lots of meat to the very end. Although the veggies and sauces weren't traditional Korean, it worked well and tasted great!The pork jowl buns were tasty, but not the best I've ever had. \\xa04 stars.My friend loved her Korean ramen and said it was she would definitely come back to order it.

The food is no doubt excellent. Came for my birthday brunch with friends. Burger with bacon, egg, and caramelized onions is the best burger I\\'ve had in Brooklyn. It\\'s not even close, but service ruined it all.First, upon arriving to a place that serves BRUNCH, we tried to open the door at 10:50AM on a cold fall day. Getting yelled at about the opening time by the lady who greeted us at the door was an unpleasant way for us to start our outing. Why was this approach ever appropriate for people who work in a hospitality industry? No matter, we were still stoked to be there and hey, it\\'s New York so we have a tolerance for this stuff.Second, at a BRUNCH place, I made the mistake of ordering iced coffee. Waitress checked to see if they had if they had it. She claimed they did not so she brought me hot coffee. Fine. I don\\'t love hot coffee with food, so I asked for a glass of ice. The waitress then shot a glance at me, scoffs, and somebody else returns by plopping down a shaker glass with a few ice cubes in it. This could have been handled so much better. This is not an odd request. Finally, a friend of mine at the brunch called ahead of time to see if she could bring a cake for candles and if they could slice etc. On the phone, they said fine and no charge. Great! A different story when we showed up and they said it would be a $5 PER PERSON charge to slice the cake. Cool thing was that it was the same guy who told both stories to my friend. Just be up front next time. We planned around this and my friend carried a cake with her for several blocks in the cold for the occasion.

My two favorite items on the menu would be their beef brisket and spare ribs. Their spare ribs is fall-off-the-bone tender and is remarkably well seasoned and marinated. It goes very well with the mac-and-cheese, which they lather into a cup (they come in three sizes). Beware -- it is incredibly filling and you may need less than you think. Their brisket always comes with the perfect lean and fat ratio. Whether you order it as a cut or in a sandwich, you will not regret it.I have had their pulled pork and lamb belly as well -- both very well done. They go great with the restaurant's hot sauce and sticky BBQ sauce.The only thing on the item that did not impress me was their sausage. Usually at BBQ joints I expect a snappy exterior and a firm bite, but the sausage here (at least the two times that I've ordered it) has a bit of a pasty texture. Still tasted great though, just not the same in terms of mouth feel. Their chicken is worth trying as well although definitely not as outstanding as the rest of their menu.The staff has always been fantastic. I don't think I've ever felt any type of negativity from them. The tall lanky dude that typically takes the orders and slices up the meat is very cordial and friendly. Did not get his name the few times I was there, but he's fantastic! There's also a bar at the front and the back of the place so lines to order drinks are never an issue!

I had an idea what I wanted to order and since there was a line behind me, I didn't want to start with a load of questions about what's this and that.I fell in love with the Eggplant Menemen (after viewing the pics) so that was my choice. I saw an extra table and seat by the window so I chose to hang out. And the wait for the food wasn't long at all. The Eggplant Menemen is a must try for everyone. I really love the creativity they used to make this dish. The taste was on-point; they are definitely conscious of the salt usage. I can tell the chef use alot of spices to enhance the flavor. The bread was also nicely toasted with a little burnt flavor which I loved. It looked really crunchy in the photo but it was soft and chewy.The decor is chic yet simple with its retro-inspired design. Chairs are low barstools that are light wooden in color along with the tables. You can also eat by the counter if you are able to grab one of the two/three seats. My only gripe is that this cafe is very small; I wish it was alittle bigger. I can imagine brunch hours would be busy due to the long waiting times. But I do believe the quality of the food makes the wait worth it.Overall, Golda definitely met my expectations and deserves multiple visits in the future.\"},\n",

They do not serve alcohol yet, but it sounds like their license is on the way.We stopped in for a couple bites while hopping around the neighborhood. We started with their pumpkin seed hummus which was topped with black sesame, sumac, and dill. I really enjoy sumac and dill, so this dish was perfect for my flavor preferences. The hummus has excellent texture; it was smooth yet not watery. The dish had a pleasant lemon flavor coming from the sumac and possible added lemon to the hummus. It's a greater starter and I'd probably go through four orders if I had a beer.Next, we shared their fried chicken sandwich with pickled cabbage and a delicious sauce. My girlfriend said it was the best chicken sandwich that see has had. Expect to see pictures of it soon on: instagram.com/adventures…The chicken was juicy and perfectly fried. It was super savory yet not a bit greasy. I loved the additional crunch from the pickled cabbage which also added very mild undertones of sourness and bitterness.All in all, the dishes were outstanding. The team does a great job of exciting all of the taste senses and building a balanced flavor and textural profile. The staff was extremely polite and friendly.

That kokkari dressing they put on it elevated the dish in more ways than one. This did not at all taste like the usual greasy potatoes you get from other establishments. The Smoked Trout Sandwich was a party in my mouth and just the right amount of food. If you want something very flavorful that will leave you satisfied but not overly full then get this. Pair this with the Fried Potatoes and you'll have a complete breakfast.That CHICKEN SANDWICH!!! Was delicious and I kinda wish I would've order that instead of the Smoked Trout. There is nothing wrong with the trout it's just that chicken is levels better than the trout and most chicken sandwiches period. The portions are huge and I was pleasantly surprised by the very very very generous size. The flavors are very unique and you aren't really going to find something like this anywhere else in the neighborhood. You should just go get it as soon as your done readying this. The only complaint I have is that its a very small place so getting a seat will be difficult. Just try to avoid coming in during the obvious rush hours.

When we got to the octopus dish, we literally could not swallow without involuntarily cringing. We called over our waitress and let her know casually that it was a little too salty but that the meal was still going okay. We politely sent the food back to the kitchen. The waitress could have been professional about it but her face just looked unimpresssed and unengaged the whole time. We got the dish back, but lol it was still... You got it... Too salty. We gave up and just finished our meal. I think if you came here for the outdoor seats with friends/casual outings, it is still worth coming.

Our dishes tasted okay, but not amazing. We got the Meat Lasagna and the Chicken Milanese with a parmesan crust. The lasagna was portioned well, but the pasta was overcooked and tasted so mushy that it blended with the meat and the sauce like a purée. Now on to the Chicken Milanese. The breaded chicken was covered with some arugula and a few cherry tomatoes cut in halves. The chicken was tasty but left us hungry, waiting for more. It would have been great if it came with a form of starch like, I don't know, potatoes.

Take note, PLG doesn't have a lot of restaurants so when a good one comes about we better do what it takes to make sure everyone knows. Like Glou for example.I walked in and was greeted by owner Jef Diesel, an absolute pleasure to dine with/at his restaurant. The interior is modern, sleek and inviting. Lots of tables, space and a lovely bar. Super large windows gives the restaurant a ton of natural light. We started with some fantastic wines and champagnes he poured for his.

The dishes that stood out and that's pretty much making me have weird cravings every day was the Meatballs, Wild Mushrooms, Pavlova and Tortilla Patata. The other dishes were super fantastic too but these I really really crave. The escargot was probably one of the best snails I've had to date. So simple with parsley butter, it almost makes you wonder why some places try and complicate it to the point of it being inedible.Let me tell you about those meatballs. He cooks them in a dish with burrata and parmesan and the flavours combined are everything you think paradise is made of. I am really not a fan of meatballs but these were so damn good. Like why?! The Tortilla Patatas are also super different. I've never seen anything like it and the spiced tomato jam leads it to a perfect gastronomic height. When I saw dessert was going to be Pavlova, my heart skipped a beat. I can eat meringue at any time of the day be it breakfast lunch or dinner or midnight.

However, the warm, modern farmhouse decor and (trying too hard to be) trendy menu is juxtaposed by mediocre service and painfully disappointing food.Our party of 4 arrived on a Sunday, around 1 pm. While we waited for a table, a couple arrived behind us and were pointed to a table. As they turned to head over, the host taps the man with menus and says, \"don\\'t forget these.\" Maybe I\\'m not milennial enough to not take note of that, but I digress.We were seated after a short wait and given menus. And then waited longer. The restaurant was busy, but not overly so, and even with staff constantly walking by no one came over to greet us. After flagging someone down, we were able to order, but had to ask twice for water. I don\\'t recall seeing any member of the staff ever smile.You pay and tip right after ordering, they take your card at the table, with the ipad used to place the orders.

After receiving the food, I\\'m convinced that they don\\'t know what culinary terms actually mean and are just using them to sound trendy. The cocktails are non-alcoholic, which it says on the menu but still means it\\'s not a cocktail. The Cosmo for what it was, was good, but the mango tango, which was described as a mango punch, tasted like watered down mango juice from concentrate.The panini used sliced bread and was not grilled, i.e., not a panini. The corn fritters weren\\'t fried... I think you know where I\\'m going with this*... and the \"hollandaise\" was just not. Also, the pastrami stack was ambitious but executed poorly. The sandwich was so uneven- some spots had the slaw, some had pickles, some onion ring, but never had a bite that had everything. Mysteriously, the stack was served a la carte while the steak panini came with a modest serving of roasted potatoes. The flatbread was very one note, that note being chipotle mayonnaise (it says aioli but couldn\\'t taste any garlic).All of that being said, the food wasn\\'t necessarily bad overall, at best just inconsistent and not what it was supposed to be.*side note: sauteeing fritter batter how it was done here doesn\\'t fully cook it and leaves it quite sticky.'},\n",

This was confusing as I saw people around us drinking coffee out of plastic cups and the baristas were making drinks in cups. It was 85 degrees, there was no air conditioning and no one would give us water. The girls at the table next to us complained about this to their waiter and asked to speak to the manager. The manager is incidentally also the chef and one of two people in the kitchen.

We felt rushed by the waiters who came 3 times in 5 minutes to ask for our orders. Apparently we couldn't order drinks first and food then either.

He asked us what we would like to order. We told him we needed more time because our friend was in the bathroom. He comes back and asks what we would like to drink but there was no drinks listed on the menu so we asked what drinks are there. All of a sudden he snaps and say he doesn't have time to go down the list and go line up at the counter if we wanted to order drinks. We were like ok then water is fine. I overheard him complaining to the barista while I was on line to order my drinks. It's funny how he has time to stand around for a good 15 minutes gossiping with the barista but no time to do his job. We waited more than half an hour to receive our lattes and food. It does not take that long to make a latte. To top it off, he never brought us our water while other tables were served water. When I went to ask about what is the hold up. They immediately brought out our drinks after. We were presented with very sloppy spilled lattes. Finally our food arrived after a good 45 minutes. The food was good and the cooks were hardworking. The other waiters and waitresses were decent. I don't understand what is with this particular waiter of ours. He doesn't want us to waste his time but okay to do that to us. I see other reviewers complaining about the same guy. Seriously, he needs to be let go or else he'll continue to drag down the reputation of this establishment. Oh did I mention about how he presented us the credit card payment machine. He stucked it out for us to slide the card and looks the other way like he's irritated. Even the couple next to our table picked up on his rude negative vibes through the whole time. Basically, when the food arrived we just wanted to finish our meal quickly to get out of there. We did not have time to enjoy our meal. We weren't even rude to him for him to behave like that in the beginning.

I was apprehensive of the mango shrimp fried rice because I question fruit in main entrees (like Hawaiian pizza...), but it was delicious. The sweetness of the mango helped balance the spiciness of the dish and combined well with the shrimp. Both fried rice dishes were cooked well and not greasy or heavy.

Once we were seated we sipped on Pear Cider which is awesome and easy to overdue by drinking too many. Though it took over 90 minutes to be seated I was happy with dinner from the apps to the main course. We had mussels as an app to share and another person had the ShortRib flatbread pizza to share which everyone who are meat eaters and they all loved it. I had the Salmon over mashed sweet potatoes and it was amazing, definitely worth the wait.Let\\'s get to my more recent visit which was the visit from HELL. I made reservations this go round because it was the weekend after Christmas and we were a party of 8. The best part about this visit was that we were seated immediately at the table that is elevated over the restaurant straight to the back. We had a waitress come over to the table by the name of TASHA remember that name and be sure to NEVER have her as your waitress EVER especially if you have people in your party that she may have liked or may have crushed on and didn\\'t get any play. This young lady was very short with us and we were in the Christmas spirit and sharing our Holiday cheer. We were ordering our apps and drinks and when some was trying to tell her \"That\\'s 7 Pear ciders\" she quickly replied \"WAIT HOLD UP, one person at a time\". That\\'s not so bad you say, however you had to see her FACE of disgust like she didn\\'t want to be there or be our server. I shared my phone with her to show her that I checked in on Yelp and I unlocked the Yelp offer for cornbread which she looked at and shunned my phone back over to me \" My Gold Iphone 5s\" REALLY. I continued to maintain my composure and began fellowshipping with my group as we waited on our drinks and apps. About 15 minutes later some of the drinks came and one of the 5 apps. Another 20 minutes later we flagged her down and she decided to bring the rest of the apps (COLD) and we inquired about the cornbread and she rolled her eyes and walked away. NOTE:We didn\\'t get the cornbread until after our entrees were served. We ordered our entrees again after flagging her down and practically begging her to come over to our table and help us as we were hungry. This young lady TASHA was THEE worst waitress I\\'ve ever had in NYC and I know that NYC is known to be cut throat or rude however I\\'m from Chicago so I know a thing or two about ignorance and how to handle it as well as how to offset it in a NICE/NASTY way.Icing on the cake: Tasha came by to clear the table without asking us if we were done with our plates or even asking if she could clear the table, she just started grabbing stuff and we had to pull plates out of her hand that we were still working on and one item in particular that she removed was the cheesecake and in the process the cheesecake feel onto the Chanel leather glove of one of the ladies at the table and you would think TASHA would acknowledge this mess with not just a look but an apology and a swift sprint to grab something to clean the glove off. Ooh NO, Tasha kept clearing the table while everyone looked with wide-eyes except me as I just can\\'t tolerate IGNORANCE and DISRESPECT for any reason for so long. I stated \"Excuse me, you just dropped cheesecake on her glove\" and she gave me this LOOK as if she was trying to CUT my throat with her eyes and walked away and came back and dropped a napkin on the table on top of the glove and walked away. She returned to drop the check and once I grabbed the check and noticed that her tip was about $85 automatically I immediately asked for a manager. My ISSUE: The manager listened to the table express a group consensus of how rude TASHA was from start to finish. No one asked to not pay the tip; we just ask that it be redirected to the kitchen for the amazing food and to the dishwashers as the dishes were clean and sparkling. We REFUSE to give her a dime; however the manager sugar coated her actions and made it seem like she may have been having a bad day as if it was acceptable for her to express her bad day toward individuals patronizing this establishment and spending a large chunk of change. The SAD part is that I\\'m sure nothing was done and she received that tip because he seemed pretty sweet on her and compassionate for her regardless of her actions which is why I have no plans on no visits to NYC to see family to patronize this establishment again or no plans to add SoCo to my list of places to try for those who look to me for travel advice due to my extensive travels.'},\n",

They were gracious though, and we were seated in the outdoor area in the back. I was apprehensive at first but the entire area is covered so even during this cold weather we were protected. Ambiance- Soco is very lively with a DJ playing music and even the people working there were feeling the music. It is very astounding how music makes people connect in ways they could not imagine. Service- This is where it got a little choppy. We had a very enthusiastic server, but the people delivering our food often times went to the wrong table. They almost gave away our Mimosa drinks! Having said that, the food came very quick... speaking of. Food- Very tantalizing. I loved the taste of my Chicken. As did my wife. She had her Lobster Shrimp and Grits. I had my allergies so she got to eat two meals (Grumbles) Red velvet was definitely a mouthful but it is just enough not to make your mouth dry. I Really enjoyed it. Such a great concept of Chicken & Red velvet waffles. Price- This is also a chippy thing. I cannot possibly justify spending what we spent on a regular occurrence. You would have to be at a special event ( Like... a birthday ;D) to feel good about some of the pricing. You can just as easily enjoy the meals at other establishments for half of what we paid. All in All, We had a decent experience. The factor of the Price is something you should keep in mind, but the food is really good and I would be quite upset if the meal wasn't as good as it was.\"},\n",
    " {'oOsJn3leUnWDfErRWMf81g': 'Came here during Sunday brunch. I was shocked to realize that the Sunday Brunch menu is different than the Saturday brunch menu. I was really looking forward to trying a particular dish. For an appetizer, we had the cornbread and mussels. The cornbread, did not taste fresh to me. It had good flavor but was a little stale. The sweet butter that was served with the cornbeard was really good. The mussels were a good serving. The sauce was good but I felt it was missing flavor. The creaminess over powered any seasoning that was in the mussels. For my entree I had the steak and eggs and my spouse had the sweet potato pancakes. I ordered my steak medium well and it came as much but the steak was tough. The au jour that came with the steak had such good flavor and complimented the steak and eggs. The sweet potato pancakes WERE THE BOMB. They were fluffy but had a nice little crisp on the outside. The blueberries and whipped cream complimented the pancakes so well. For drinks we had the Brooklyn Bellini, Bourbon Street Mango Juice, the Brooklyn Brown, and a Singapore Sling. My favorite drink was the Brooklyn Bellini. It was the perfect Brunch cocktail.

Brunch used to be bottomless but now they offer just pitchers that was a tad bit disappointing. My friend and I started with the cornbread which was scrumptious! For our meals my friend ordered the steak and eggs, I ordered fish and chips, and we had the Mac and cheese to share. The food was good no complaints. Service was fine too.

My wife is celiac and coming to a restaurant that is 100% gluten free is always a treat for her and coming to a place that has GREAT (I do mean great) fried chicken is a treat for me. This is where Daleview made me a fan. The biscuits were tasty but the stars of the show were the fried chicken and pulled pork. The owner's wife has a gluten allergy and the owner is a perfectionist which leads to a great meal. I would definitely recommend one of their fried chicken biscuit sandwiches (there are 4-5) and their mustard based pulled pork is also also a great option. Their cocktails and beer are also another plus. Try this place out if you want some great fried chicken on a biscuit, even if you're not gluten free... then you can have one of their gluten full beers as well!\"},\n",

I missed out on a fresh biscuit, but the people who came in 20 mins after me got in on the full freshness. But, I'm getting ahead of myself.The Freaky Fritatta was good enough. It's the only non-sweet vegetarian item on the menu. The fritatta itself squished out kind of quickly, but there's no denying -- these biscuits are top notch! \\xa0I should have ordered another right then, but by time I made up my mind to do so, 7 people walked in, and as only one server was on, I couldn't wait around for that. I've only had better biscuits in Charleston, but that place just changed their recipe for the worst, so technically, these are the best biscuits I have access to. \\xa0My wife's people are from the same town as the owner, so I trust he won't change his secret down-home recipe. \\xa0 I'll return for some sweet and possibly and just plain biscuits, and possibly a hot drink.

Let me start with the grits. I've never had blue corn grits before. It was SO GOOD! \\xa0Why don't more places do this ?? This was probably the highlight for me. Their biscuits are also really good. I didn't really care for the egg frittata, so I took that out and just ate the biscuit with jam and bacon. Next time, I'll likely just get a plain biscuit with a side of jam. They also sell savory chicken biscuits, which I intend on trying again in the future.

It is almost 100% gluten free with the exception being regular beer. They are eager to support NY alcohol producers and only serve NY State libations, which I thought was pretty rad. Ordered the Cobb and Haven biscuit sandwiches. The chicken and biscuits were flavorful, moist, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.

We started with apps, 3 orders of the yucca croquettes, 2 chicken arepas, and 2 orders of the tamarind calamari. For drinks, i was super excited that they had a hot drink with chocolate and chili so i opted for that. My friends had margaritas.The apps cane out pretty quick. As usual, the yucca croquettes were delicious. My favorite dish of the entire night. They are highly recommended! The arepas were a no for me. I took a small half and even that was too much, but I\\'ve also never had an arepa and have nothing to compare it to. The calamari was a big soggy. I think they used a bit too much tamarind and it kinda clashed with the texture, but i enjoyed it nonetheless. As for the drinks...i hated the hot chocolate drink. The alcohol overpowered the entire drink, and the chili felt like a kick in the face. It was subtly like i expect from my Mexican chocolate drinks. \\xa0My friends, however enjoyed their margaritas.This is when things got a bit sticky. After the apps our waiter disappeared. 20 minutes later, and still nothing. There were about three more groups that came in during this time so i kind of gave her some slack as she was alone. The wait became a bit annoying after this, we were out of drinks and water too so we were all feeling antsy. I asked her if i could switch my drink for the margarita which she seemed a little annoyed by but i barely touched it. I even added simple syrup to try to make it drinkable.Dinner arrives finally! I got the pumpkin soup which was ok. It was kind of sweet and the cheese was good but too much was overwhelming. My friend ordered the pasta which he devoured.

At $13, it came with scrambled eggs and bacon - such a great deal! The hanger steak and eggs was prepared a bit under for our liking, but still delicious. It came with an avocado salsa on top.

Again, the atmosphere just seemed very bland in here as I think someone else noted; there's no real vibe and it's just not very interesting. It's too sterile maybe? Already knowing the $11 menu price upon completion of my drink I had the bartender my card to close out and she walks away and then returns to tell me that there is a $20 minimum and asks me if I have cash. Surprisingly I actually do, and as I was annoyed, i decided to not argue and just pay it but I first ask how much just out of habit whenever I hand over cash. She tells me $12. Confused, I hand her $15 and she returns with my $3 change and sets it on the bar. I assume she wasn't expecting me to tip so she added the extra $1 to the price??

That said, my boyfriend loved the tuna one, and eagerly ate the whole thing after hearing I didn't like it (not enough different textures for me, just tasted kind of mushy). We also got the queso and 2 carnitas tacos. The queso was pretty disappointing -- I'd head good things about it, so was expecting a lot, but it was really kind of bland? Definitely needed some salt/pepper/any spices, really. They give you corn tortillas to go with it, so you can make your own cheesy tacos, which was interesting, although I would have preferred tortilla chips (making the DIY queso tacos was more labor intensive than I had really wanted). And at $14 the queso definitely isn't cheap. The carnitas tacos, on the other hand, were excellent. Pretty tiny but very hot, well balanced, and flavorful.

I went there at the suggestion of Samuel B., fantasy league sociopath, who recommended it. Met up with him plus league staples Kyle N. and John A. (commissioner profiled in the Washington Post)It\\'s a small \"artisanal\" menu split between appetizers and entrees. We had the cucumber salad, eggplant, turnip cake, claims & basil (incl. scallion pancake), and pork buns for appetizers, plus mullet roe noodles, beef rolls, and something else that I forgot. The only \"bust\" was the cucumber salad, which felt like something you could easily make at home and that depended less on a creative recipe than the intrinsic tastes of the cucumber itself.Win Son allows you the choice of sitting outside or inside, and if it\\'s a nice day, I definitely recommend the former option. It\\'s not because I necessarily love being outdoors. On the contrary, see my Las Veganization of the world sudden-death climate change strategy plan where we will all have to live in bubbles but get to watch Lady Gaga and Cirque du Soleil shows all day. But the inside of Win So is awful. Sadly, like many restaurant, it\\'s taken the advice that loud pulsating \"club\" music is desirable. It really impedes paced eating and conversation. Were we inside, I would have given this place a flat 3, maybe even 2 star, rating. That\\'s how bad it is. If you want a club, go to Live 1OAK or Catch or whatever.Final note: Samuel B. had me thinking Win Son was a hole-in-the-wall place with bad decor and suspect sanitary standards that served delicious food. It\\'s not. It\\'s incredibly well manicured, and it made me wonder whether the place is truly owned by actual Taiwanese/Asian proprietors. BZZZ!!!... no. It\\'s run by one \"Trigg Brown.\" This raises a perennial question here: is this cultural appropriation to be lamented or cultural syncretism to be celebrated? We debated it as a group, and we settled on the latter, though not without some unease. I personally was finally swayed when I recalled that my favorite Peking duck joints in NYC are all owned by people who don\\'t look like me. John A. said that the best pizza shops are owned by Albanians, and as an Italian, he doesn\\'t take offense.

It comes with 6 dumplings. The chili vinaigrette has an interesting flavor. The were griddled perfectly and came right off the grill. Overall, these were my least favorite item that we ordered.Sloppy Bao: We loved the fluffy bao bun.The pork stew filling covered in peanuts was unlike any bao bun that we have had, but we really liked it. This coms with 2 bao buns. This was our favorite item that we ordered.Sesame Noodles: Very flavorful noodles with sweet sesame sauce.

We were the third party to be seated.My party of three got the cucumber salad, guohua street salad, clams & basil, flys head, and the sesame noodles. We also got two Taiwanese beers since it was $3 during HH.Food came quickly. Here's the breakdown:Cuke salad: 6.8/10 it was topped with fried garlic and cilantro. I think the dish could have been colder. The flavor was good but the cukes were too limp and room temp.Guohua salad: 8/10 it's a salad with shrimp and ripe mango, large leaves of mint and basil. This was the best dish of the night... just because it was the least saltiest. It was a good salad. The base seemed to be cabbage.Clams & basil: 6.8/10 this comes with a whole scallion pancake to dip in. I loves clams drowning in gravy. This was exactly that. First bite was amazing. Salty but good. However, as you keep eating this dish, the salt just overwhelms you. If you get this, get a refreshing veggie side dish to offset the heaviness.Flys head: 7/10 this is the dish I was most excited for. I saw a munchies video on the chefs of win son and flys head seemed so unique. It's a ton of garlic chives with pieces of pork shoulder. The dish was good... but again very salty. It actually kind of tasted like what a pork and chive dumpling would taste like, minus the outside peel. Kind of underwhelming. They give you a bowl of rice to top it over.Sesame noodles: 6.7/10 I though this would taste like Dan Dan noodles but it was not peanutty nor sesame-y. It tasted like the Korean black bean noodle dish... but salty. You getting the theme of this restaurant? LolI love Pine & Crane and joy in LA. It's a hipsters take on Taiwanese food. I think they nailed it perfectly. Win Son.... I think it doesn't quite reach that level. They need to tone down on the salt in case you didn't get that from my review lolParking was relatively easy. Service was great. I doubt I'd go back.\"},\n",

We were in the area for a workout class so decided to stop by here for dinner since I've heard so many good things about this place. Honestly, this was a decent place for Taiwanese Fusion food!We got the Lu Rou Fan, Dan Zi Mian, and Pan Seared Dumplings. I was a HUGE fan of the Pan Seared Dumplings and liked the Lu Rou Fan! The Pan Seared Dumplings are basically xiaolongbao that was pan grilled so you got an additional crunch texture to the softness of the skin and silkiness of the soup. But also that sauce was AMAZING! Packed so full of flavor and if you add their chili oil to that, that's just amazinggg.I liked their version of the Lu Rou Fan! It was a good amount of toppings for the amount of rice they gave and the toppings themselves were very good. But I wish they gave us more sauce because in the end, I felt like I needed more to accompany the amount of rice that was given. I was a little disappointed by the Dan Zi Mian. I felt like they added a bit too much fish sauce so it tasted quite fishy... otherwise the noodles were cooked perfectly and the condiments in that dish were wonderful!I would definitely come back here for Taiwanese Fusion food! The food here is on par, with some minor setbacks, but overall very solid restaurant.\"},\n",
    " {'3gqKLANaXNsHZnPDjKrcTg': \"Win Son isn't very traditional, and I had the most expensive 滷肉飯 (stewed pork meat) I've ever had there, but everything is delicious. This is slightly upscale fusion done right by Asian Americans who obviously love and understand the entirety of their culinary toolbox.滷肉飯 and 蚵仔煎 are Taiwanese classics, and Win Son's versions are worth the premium. The 滷肉飯 comes with a stewed egg: mix the gooey yolk into the rice with the pork for a treat. Like almost everything else here, it's topped with an almost-excessive pile of scallions and garlic chips, which add snap and crunch in addition to flavor. The rice is cooked right, and the pork is rich and tender. The 蚵仔煎 here comes plated with a swirl of green sauce that tastes like pesto. The egg doesn't have as much potato starch mixed in as some other places do, making it less slimy. The oysters are plump and briny accents in the slightly-smoky egg. They also don't do the sweet red sauce that usually comes with 蚵仔煎, which is fine by me because I'm not such a fan of the sauce.The 生煎包 are small, but the ratio of skin to filling is spot on. Each bite yields a combination of crisped bottom skin, chewy top skin, rich pork, and soup. They're not as juicy as your typical 小籠包, but it was definitely a nice touch.The vegetables here aren't quite as strong. The eggplant is nicely crisped on the outside while being soft and melty inside, but the sugar overwhelms the other flavors, even the copious amount of peanut powder costing the whole dish. The pea shoots are fine, but not quite as juicy or crisp as they could be, and the garlic chips on top can't quite make up for a slight lack of garlic flavor in the actual vegetables.\"},\n",

I get it you're trying to elevate the dishes and cater to a specific market of folks, mainly the hipster that have congregated to Williamsburg, but in doing so you have stomped, chewed up and spit out essentially the spirit of legitimate Chinese food. Came here with a group of 8 and basically ordered the entire menu along with the special of the day. Everything here honestly was needlessly expensive and pretentious, and was incredibly hard to share with a large group. In trying to elevate these already wonderful food items this place has essentially defiled these traditional dishes with weird ingredients that for the most part do not work well with each other. There were however two standout dishes that i thought would serve better as just appetizers as opposed to main menus, the big chicken bao and the oyster omelette. Big chicken bao the chicken was seasoned incredibly well, super tender and moist and the generous helping of what i assume to be made from scratch mayo worked incredibly well with the crunchiness of the chicken. Oyster omelette was amazing the sweetness of both the sauce and the basil aoli paired really well! the fresh basil combined with the basil aoli gave this dish a super strong slap of basil which left an incredibly pleasant aroma and taste as i bit into this item. These two items kind of redeemed this place as they were really top notch, otherwise this place is a skip in my opinion since most of these dishes are just appetizers, most of the items fall short and some of the most iconic Taiwanese dishes are just left out completely\"},\n",

After I was served I noticed on the menu board that for the same price I paid they offered a special including chips. But it wasn\\'t suggested to me. I guess it was also the vibe of the place that bugged me. No one asked how the food was. The cashier and a counter person spent a lot of time texting and talking on their phones instead of attending to customers. Since these people are also food handlers, is that even sanitary.

    " {'uAy3zyNCmDPO0RpdGjEAdg': 'This spot has been on my foodie list for quite some time and I finally mustered up some free time to try it out. First things first - I must admit, I had high expectations which might\\'ve led to my disappointment. Before going, I read a few reviews to mentally prepare myself. Many of the reviews referenced the crab cake sliders and lucky for us, it was a Thursday and there happened to be specials on Thursday where you could select 3 menu item specials for $20. This sold me. So we headed to Crabby Shack. I knew it was a small restaurant, but surprisingly enough, we went around 8:45 ish on a Thursday and it wasn\\'t packed at all. We quickly found a table (and parking wasn\\'t too bad either!). Upon entering, the cashier advised we could take a menu to our seats and then could order up front after reviewing the menu. The menu wasn\\'t too descriptive, so of course I had some questions. I approached the cashier and asked her how it worked, did you order the seafood as a base and then add sauce?! She totally disregarded me and said... \"just tell me what you want and I\\'ll explain after. \" I told her what I wanted ... and she never explained?! I ordered 1 lb. of the Alaskan snow crab and 1/2 lb. of spicy steamed shrimp. My main question was how would they be served? She didn\\'t ask if we wanted it sauced. I then proceeded to order a side of cornbread and an appetizer of the crab cake sliders. Initially, before putting in the order and while reviewing the menu, I noticed the Thursday special wasn\\'t listed on the menu as referenced on yelp. However, there is a sign by the cashier. When I asked the cashier about it, she said the soup was sold out. I asked if we could get two crab cakes in lieu of the soup + another item on the specials list and she said no and quickly moved the sign. Not sure why they couldn\\'t substitute a remaining side of the soup sold out, or at least honor it since the sign was there?! THE FOOD: The crab cakes were decent. The buns were soft and my favorite part. The crab cake itself was tasty, but for two tiny sliders ... not worth $16 in my humble opinion. The Alaskan crab, as I presumed came in a clear bag sauced. I was confused because I didn\\'t know it came sauced up, I wish I could\\'ve chosen a sauce for it to be sauced in. Nonetheless - decent. Not sure if it was worth $27, the sauce was lacking in taste and not much in the bag for the big snow crab legs to soak up. The spicy steamed shrimp was good. I enjoyed the sauce. The cornbread was cold when it was served,I\\'m sure it would\\'ve been tasty if served warm. The cornbread went really well with the spicy sauce that came with the steamed shrimp. The iced tea was decent, although the woman at the front forgot to give it to us and then proceeded to tell us that we didn\\'t pay for it, when we did? We eventually got it after telling her we did in fact pay for it... and then realized it wasn\\'t even really worth it, as it wasn\\'t even cold, it was almost like a warm tea? Would\\'ve been tasty if cooled! Overall: 2.5/5, but yelp doesn\\'t allow for it. Glad I knocked it off my bucket list. Side note: they\\'re a little pricey - everything came up to about $70 (1 lb. Alaskan snow crab legs; 1/2 lb. spicy steamed shrimp; 1 side order of cornbread - which literally consisted of one slice of (cold) cornbread; 1 order of crab cake sliders - basically 2 (super)mini crab cake burgers; and 1 iced tea).'},\n",

I ordered the filet mignon burger and my boyfriend ordered the wagyu burger, and both of us asked for our meat to be medium rare. We waited for a really long time for our food. Probably around 40 minutes. When our food came out, it looked amazing... until I started cutting into it. My filet mignon was not medium rare - it was basically rare. It was so rare that I could barely taste anything. The thing is, my boyfriend's wagyu burger wasn't medium rare, it was medium well. I have no idea how the chef managed to mess both of them up. After eating half of my burger, I decided I might as well talk to the waiter about it. I flagged him down and notified him that it was a little too rare for my taste, and he brought it back to the kitchen. I waited... another 20 minutes for my burger to come back. I noticed that my onions on the side were gone :( but I literally just devoured the rest because I was so hungry.

The steak was cooked as asked, a nice medium rare, and came with a variety of sauces that we all used to flavor it to our liking. The table favorite was the soy lemon sauce- it was almost all gone when we finished the steak! The porterhouse for two with a side was definitely enough for three people with an appetizer. We also got the broccoli, which although the hollandaise was nice, wasn't really noteworthy. The service here was really nice and accommodating- refilling drinks/water/chips as needed as we waited for our steak, and not rushing us out afterwards.

We got the portion for 2 ($150) which comes with 6 3-inch slices of meat (about 2-3 bites per slice) so it's small but it is so packed with flavor, so rich and buttery, that if you get some sides or appetizers you should be satisfied. Wagyu comes from cows bred in japan that are fed a special diet and raised so that they have a high fat content that is intermuscular/marbled within the muscle which creates a texture and taste unlike any other steak. Every bite of meat is like butter with a seared crisp on the outside. I don't know how else to describe it. We also got the wagyu sushi which was my favorite. The matcha cake was good too.

I was hoping for delicious fried okra and didn't get it. Their mac and cheese is great with the thick melted cheese and salty cracker crumb topping.

First off, it\\'s vastly overpriced for the portions. The specialty alcoholic drinks are $13 and served in child-sized glasses. A sweet tea cost my friend $5, no refills of course. But the kicker was when I ordered the grilled wings appetizer. My mouth dropped when the waiter brought it to the table...I couldn\\'t help but look around and wonder if I was being punk\\'d. In front of me were three of the scrawniest, driest wings I had ever seen. (Please see the attached pic.) AND THEY COST $11. I\\'ll give them this--the flavor was good. Too bad there was no real meat to taste them on. I mean, really, wtf. I ordered a side of collard greens with them ($7, but that\\'s not too abnormal for a side dish) that was decent. I wasn\\'t mad at them and would eat them again, but I don\\'t think I\\'d pay more than $5 for the amount served.My friends were similarly disappointed with their meals and drink orders. One did the wings and elotes, one did the catfish (which she said tasted like dirt) and the buffalo chicken bucket (which she said was dry and tasted old), and they split a side of mac and cheese, which they both said was \"just ok.\" They ended up sending all their food back.What was especially upsetting is that when we asked to speak to the manager and talked about a) the freshness of the food, b) the quality of the food, and c) the portion sizes, the manager had the audacity to say to us, \"Well this isn\\'t a Popeye\\'s drive thru.\" !!! The gall! Sir, if this was a Popeye\\'s, I would\\'ve been satisfied with my order. This most certainly is NOT a Popeye\\'s drive thru, but I wish it had been. I am trying to resist saying that that comment was racial in tone because it was said to three black women by a white man, but f* it, I just did. Nobody would insinuate to white people that they\\'re used to eating at fast food places and can\\'t understand the difference between a drive thru and a sit-down restaurant.After our complaints and our lack of eating, you\\'d think the manager would offer to comp our drinks and/or food, make us something else, or at the very least, apologize. None of the above happened, and we were delivered a check for $128 for nearly inedible food. My first thought was to leave without paying, but I\\'m an adult, so I paid for this terrible meal and, after this review, will put the bad experience out of my mind.I must say as a disclaimer: The actual price of the food wasn\\'t the problem. I am from and live in DC, where prices are exactly the same, but VALUE is high. No one balked at the prices of the food or drinks until they were brought out. I feel like I need to say that before someone thinks that my party and I were being cheap or were unaccustomed to city prices...anyone who has been to DC knows that nothing here is cheap.If you were looking forward to trying Sweet Chick, don\\'t go to this one. This is the only location I\\'ve been to, so I can\\'t vouch for the others, but I can definitively say THIS is not the one.'},\n",

They don\\'t offer the specialty ones like buffalo until dinner time. You can also get the Mac n cheese, shrimp and grits, and BLT salad. I got the rosemary and mushroom waffle, and shared the Mac n cheese with my friend. Loved the Mac n cheese, definitely rich and cheesy enough.

Sweet Chick had a limited menu appropriately titled, \"In-Between Brunch + Dinner\" for patrons dining between 4-6pm daily. Great idea!I had to order their popular dish, chicken and waffles. I never knew there were so many different types of waffles. Where have I been? I mean classic, bacon + cheddar, dried cherry, rosemary + mushroom, spiced pecan, and apple cinnamon. Huh? How am I supposed to choose? I weighed the pros and cons between spiced pecan and apple cinnamon, which won lol. If that was not enough, we were provided with three different types of butter. No clue what they were and I didn\\'t bother asking, because I wanted my taste buds to do all of the talking. I liked the strawberry as well as the apple cinnamon butter.

To begin, I went by myself at around 1 on a Saturday, which is when they're most busy. I was told I would have a 45 min wait but in actuality it was less than 30. Of course I had to order their chicken and waffles. Chicken was well seasoned and moist all the way through, which is fairly difficult to achieve so kudos to them. Waffles came with 3 kinds of butter: lemon, herb, and berry. My favorite was a toss up between the lemon and herb. Waffles were very fluffy and the flavored butter complimented the syrup perfectly. Also ordered a side of home fries which although expensive, was a sizable portion and quite tasty.\"},\n",

    " {'WyFvM4kmgNm19jip0tDBqA': 'Bar LunAtico is a small place but it definitely has a big aura. I joined my friend her for a couple of drinks on Saturday night and thankfully she got us a table because it gets insanely packed. Drinks: Jane was our server she was super sweet and she wasn\\'t over bearing as I did take about 15 mins to order from the vast drink menu. I ended up getting an Old Fashioned and I have no regrets it was made perfectly. My friend switched over to a cocktail the \" Star of Midnight \" which was awesome if you like gin and ginger go for this. Overall the drinks were awesome. Food: I\\'ve been here for drinks but never food and my best advice is to NOT go hungry. This place is definitely a gastropub and you should know that before ordering. I had the \"Charcuterie\" , the \"Cheeses\" and \"Cracked Aloreña Olives\" alongside \"Sourdough Bread w. Olive Oil\" All of the dishes were insanely good and completely complimented the drinks and each other. The meats were buttery in flavor and you could tell they were freshly cut into each plate for serving. The charcuterie also came with pickled hot peppers and I suggest you take advantage of them because they compliment the meats. The cheeses were really good as well and served with honey with a sprinkle of black pepper and it was also a very good compliment to the other components of the dish. The olives were nutty, and sharp but had a hint of sweetness that can only be explained by you trying yourself. The bread and olive oil is a nice touch if you just want to munch whilst enjoying the music. The only thing I would change is the menu descriptions because I\\'m only seeing what the names of the charcuterie and cheeses are online and that\\'s slightly disappointing.Ambiance: Again, secure your seat before 730/8 because you will have to stand to enjoy the music. There is a very diverse crowd but for the most part everyone came to drink and hear a live band. The band was really cool and I enjoyed the music, however after the end of the first set the manager/owner made an announcement that the tip jar would be coming around and that a $10 minimum is suggested. Now I\\'m very clear this is a fancy gastropub however we\\'re in bed stuy Brooklyn and I just feel it wasn\\'t appropriate to ask so much of a crowd who spent at least $50 on 2 drinks. I still gave the $10 because they deserved it but I felt that was a bit much. Overall I enjoyed LunÀtico and will return to see more live music and enjoy amazing cocktails.'},\n",

I wonder what kind of day he was having?I myself had the classic eggs benedict, with the sautéed kale instead of meat. The dish was served with a salad in a vinaigrette, radishes and onion that seemed pickled, and potatoes. I think this might be the best eggs benedict I have ever had. All of the parts of this dish were perfectly seasoned, and made sense together. The potatoes had a wonderful crisp/crunch on the outside and cozy softness on the inside.

It\\'s a shame because the late night kitchen really is a blessing, but at this point it\\'s worth going into the city for something comparable. Step your game up.'},\n",
    " {'k8iVVuYic-fCgmzzfDkGNA': 'Good food and the drinks are great too but there is a really douchey hipster(ish)bartender he has \\xa0dirty blonde hair above the shoulder length \\xa0probably wearing some pattern button up the day you walk in...just avoid him and you\\'re good. Our friends ordered drinks and they sent the wrong ones and the bartender left them and when she left to go get new ones and this guy came in and only said \"vodka tonics?\" Pointing at the wrong drinks she had brought before and we answered yes and he proceeded to just take them and walk away. It was so rude and just uncalled for. They were the wrong drinks but that wasn\\'t the issue it was the way he inserted himself into our space just to take drinks back and then he literally looked at us as he poured them down the drain. We really didn\\'t care about the drinks but his whole attitude was unnecessary and petty and ridiculous but anyway we generally love this place we haven\\'t been in weeks this guy is new so don\\'t let him stray you away. Still leaving 2 stars though because this experience was not ideal at all.'}]"
